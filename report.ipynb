        "This report is a literature review on article based on gradient based learning and specifically focused on Convolutional Neural Networks.There are many different types of neural networks and CNN is a special type of multiple layer neural network use for pattern recognisation and used in my computer vision application. This article specifically investigates into the process and methods used for document recognisation, hand written character recognisation and online character recognisation at the time of publication. At the time of the publication of the article, Le-Net5 was the most advanced Convolutional Neural Netwrok while there where other methods like SVM, KNN, VSVM, etc where avaliable. Writer also emphesises on the fact how earlier methods required designer need to hand crafted feature extraction method which use to be time consuming and labour and compute intensive, meanwhile the system could not be generalised and needed to be changed with individual system. Convolution neural network had self feature extraction methods which helped to generalise the system with minimal or no changes. One of the best example of this is if you are building a model using CNN you can use a pretrained model from VGG16, RasNet(2015) google inception models etc to boost the performance of your model.

        "The objective of this paper is to investigate on the benefits of Gradient based learning using Graph Transformer Network over the clasical methods of heuristic segementation alogrithim for pattern recognisation. Classical methods were not able to solve high-dimensional parttern recognisation and requires maximum preprocessing while gradient based learning using GTN significantly reduces the requirement for preprocessing while being able to work with high-dimensional data which is the one of the reason CNN is less compute intensive. The main challenge that writer tries to address in this article is the challenge of handwriting recognisation and online handwritting recognisation with gradient based learning using using GTN. Considering the high varivalibity of the handwriting dataset and requirement of invariable model for handwriting recognisation different set of experiement were conducted. Writer successfully combined different classifiers like boosting with LeNet-4 to increase performance of the model. In the experiment, writer tested the problem with many classifier like nearest neighbour, linear and pairwise classifier, polynominal classifier, RBFN, etc to validate and compare the results of gradient based learning. This article also elobrates on how gradient based learning has eleminated the requirement for hand crafted feature extraction and introduced use of automatic learning for feature extraction. The second part of the experiment demonstrates the advantage of Space Displacement Neural Network(SSDN) over classical Heuristic Over-Segmentation and reselience of SDNN to noise in the data. Here to create real-world scenerio of data noise writer introduces 10% degradation on training sample with salt and paper using random pixel inversion where Heurestic Over-segmentation failed becaused of the noise while SDNN was not effected by the degradation.   \n"

        "This paper cannot be considered innovative base on the fact that it fouses on the comparasion of existing methods in the industry. The experiment conducted by the team of writer are the recreation of the existing Le-Net1, LeNet4 and LeNet5 for comparasion of the performance and analysis of efficency of these CNN methods with other existing methods like SVM, VSVM, KNN, Polynominal and linear methods, etc. In the first experiment, the writer states that using LeNet5 model they were able to achieve 0.8% error on test set with some modification of dataset and also where able to achieve 0.7% error on boosted LeNet4 model while SVM and VSVM where able to achieve 1% and 1.1% error on test set with 60% increase computational cost demonstrating the superior performance and efficeiency of Convloutonal Neural Network. In the second experiment, SDNN model is used to demonstrate the noise resilence of the SDNN model over clasical method and along with that writer also conducted some experiment "
